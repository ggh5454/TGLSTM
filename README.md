# Time Gated LSTM for Irregular Time Series

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a variant of the Vanilla LSTM that is designed to handle irregular time intervals between time samples. The modified LSTM structure is referred to as the **Time Gated LSTM (TGLSTM)**. This model is based on the paper *"Nonuniformly Sampled Data Processing Using LSTM Networks"* by Safa Onur Sahin and Suleyman Serdar Kozat. You can access the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8478179/).

The repository provides a detailed implementation of [TGLSTM](https://github.com/FedericOldani/TGLSTM/tree/master).
